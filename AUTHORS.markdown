Analytics was started by [Edward Kmett](https://github.com/ekmett) in response to a question by [Alec Heller](https://github.com/deviant-logic) about if he should use `bound` to implement datalog. It has since somewhat expanded in scope.

`hash` was split out of the `analytics` repository.

The suggestion for adding `Hashable1` and `Hashable2` came from prolonged discussions on the topic with Dan Doel. However, any errors in the implementation are my fault.
